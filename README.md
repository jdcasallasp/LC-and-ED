# Description

This repository contains the datasets of the article “Linguistic Complexity and Economic Development”

IQ y PPP: Contains the data of IQ and GDP PPP per capita for the given countries.

Immigrants, lc n gdp: contains the data with the average over the last 30 years from 2023 of the proportion of immigrants as the total population, the Linguistic Complexity value for the country and de GDP PPP per capita for the country.

K-Means migrants n lc: It’s the script in Jupyter Notebook to get the clusters by K-means using the variables Immigrants as percentage of total population and LC value. (Must be used the dataset “Immigrants, lc n gdp”

LC assigned to countries: It’s a table that explain details about assignment of the LC value for the tested countries.

LC n IQ: Data of IQ and LC values.

LC y GDP: Data of LC values and GDP per capita for the countries.

LC: It’s the tier list of LC values for languages.

SC construction: Contains the calculation of the SC by counting the 4 variables that composes it.

Script lc n ed: It’s the script developed in R where the final calculation of the 2SLS econometric analysis is made, the dataset “datos organizados 2.0” it’s required to use.

Datos organizados 2.0: This dataset contains the main information of all the analysis, gathering all the variables relevant for the econometric research.

Text files: Contains compressed all the .txt files that were used to calculate the LC for each language, the method it’s exposed clearly and detailed in https://github.com/katehret/measuring-language-complexity by @katehret.
